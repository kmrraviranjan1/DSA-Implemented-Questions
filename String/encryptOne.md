Description
Encryption is the process of converting a plaintext message into cipher
text which can be decoded back into the original message. An encrypti
on algorithm along with a key is used in the encryption and decryption
of data. There are several types of data encryptions which form the ba
sis of network security. Encryption schemes are based on block or stre
am ciphers.
Today, your task is to encrypt and print the encrypted string. You will be
given a single line which contains alphabets, numbers and symbols, fol
lowed by a number K. You need to encrypt it in a way such that every c
haracter in the string is rotated by the given fixed number K.
Only encrypt Alphabets and Numbers. (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9) . All Symbol
s, such as - , ; %, should remain unencrypted.
Look at the sample test case for better understanding.
