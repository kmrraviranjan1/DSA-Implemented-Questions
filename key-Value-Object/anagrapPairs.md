Anagram Pairs 
Description

Given n strings S1, S2, ... , Sn. Find the number of pairs i,j where i<j and i and j both range from 1 to n such that Si is an anagram of Sj.


Input
The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the number of test cases. Then t test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000).

The next n lines of each test case contain a string Si whose length is 10.


Output
For each test case, print the answer: The number of pairs.
