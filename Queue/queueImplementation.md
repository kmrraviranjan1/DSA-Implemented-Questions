These are the queue operations that we are going to implement:
enqueue → To add elements at the end of the queue.
dequeue → To remove an element from the front of the queue.
peek → To get the front element without removing it.
isEmpty → To check whether an element is present in the queue or not.
printQueue → To print the elements present in the queue.
